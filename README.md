# Theoretical Questions

**Q1) What is the difference between Git and GitHub?**  
Git is a version control system used on my own computer to track changes in projects. It lets me go to all versions, work on different branches, and keep a full history of my project. It’s helpful even if I’m working alone.

GitHub is a website that hosts Git projects online. It helps me share my code with my team, review changes, and manage my tasks.

**Q2) Explain the difference between git pull and git fetch:**  
The difference between git pull and git fetch is in how they bring updates from a remote repository.

When I use `git fetch`, Git downloads the latest changes without adding them to my current version. This lets me see what’s new, without changing anything in my project.

On the other hand, `git pull` downloads the changes and adds them right away to my current project, so my project is updated immediately.

I think `git fetch` is safer than `git pull`. It makes me feel more comfortable to see all updates before adding them to the project.

**Q3) What is the purpose of the `.gitignore` file?**  
The `.gitignore` file tells Git to ignore certain files or folders and not track them in the project. This helps to stop temporary files or personal settings, like cache files or program settings, from being added to the repository. Using this file keeps the project clean and focused on important files only, making it easier and safer to manage the code.

**Q4) Describe the steps to contribute to an open-source project on GitHub:**  
1. Choose an open source project on GitHub.  
2. Fork the project to copy it to your own account.  
3. Clone the project to your computer using Git.  
4. Create a new branch to work on your changes.  
5. Edit the code and save your changes (commit).  
6. Push your changes to your branch on GitHub.  
7. Open a Pull Request to ask to merge your changes into the original project.
